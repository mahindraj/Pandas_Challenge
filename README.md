# Pandas_Challenge

As part of this week’s challenge, I was tasked to analyse PyCity Schools in terms of their performances in math and reading for both District and Charter Schools. I took reference for both CSV files for schools and students for the district. Listed below is a summary of my findings and conclusions from this week’s challenge: 

1.	Overall, it seems that when more resources are spent on something, the better its performance should be. But the data does show the opposite. The schools with the lowest spending ranges (less than $585 per student) have delivered better results in average math and reading scores as well as better passing rates for students overall and in both math and reading. These schools not only had lower per student budget, but their overall total budgets were also less compared to other schools in the district.

2.	Small-sized (less than 1000 students) and medium-sized (1000 to 2000 students) had almost similar average scores (about 83 for both math and reading) and passing rates (about 93% for math, 96% for reading, and 90% overall). These schools outperformed the large-sized schools (2000 to 5000 students) especially in terms of passing scores.

3.	Charter schools clearly outperformed the District schools by having higher average scores as well as passing rates. The top 5 best performing schools based on overall scores are Charter whereas the bottom 5 are District. It could be to the fact that charter schools have a smaller number of students, but no correlation can be drawn from the provided data to support this reasoning. It shows that students in all grades had almost similar academic performance across all categories.

4.	To summarise, students tend to perform better in reading (79%-97%) as compared to maths (65%-94%) in terms of passing scores. The overall passing rates (52%-91%) are comparatively lower than the average of passing rates for math and reading. This indicates that not all the students scoring 70 or higher in math are scoring the same in reading and the other way around.
